    ONDISCOVERY
    {
        // Objects always known

        Sun = Our primary sun, Terminus is quite bright. You can't miss it.
        Eterna = Our secondary sun, Eterna's glow is easy to spot at night. In the daytime its easily missed, but only if you're not looking up.
        Damocles = Damocles is so close to Haven that despite not being all that large, its reflected light is just as bright as Eterna's
        Haven = Haven, our home planet. It's not the greatest place to live, but we make do.


        // Objects that need to be discovered in Hard mode only

        Brink = It looks like this planet we found ourselves on actually had a second, much smaller moon this whole time! Apparently you can even see it with the unaided eye.
        Cerberus = This planet's right next door, and would make a good early target for our probes and astronauts. It seems to have rings, and is pretty big and bright too - you can easily see it from Haven.
        Tempest = This has got to be the bluest thing in the solar system. It seems like it'd be great for gravity assists, and we're told some people can even make out its phases.
        Achlys = Big, dense, and pink. All the sci-fi writers want this to be some paradise world but so close to Terminus it's probably pretty hellish. It's clearly visible in the daytime sky.

        // Discoverable in Medium and above

        Acheron = From here this seems to be a pretty typical moon. It's visible in the nighttime sky a short distance from its parent, though you'll need a telescope to make anything out.
        Warden = Warden looks unexpectedly fuzzy, and our scientists believe this to mean it has an atmosphere of its own. Some think it might even have water, though the Wardenite swimming opportunities aren't very certain. It can be seen from Haven, too.
        Typhos = While this moon doesn't seem particularly large, it's bright enough to see with your own eyes in the nighttime sky all the same. It also seems to orbit backwards, which is quite unusual.
        Kere = From here this seems to be a pretty typical moon. It's visible a short distance from its parent if you catch it in the twilight, though you'll need a telescope to make anything out.
        Revenant = A roughly Haven-sized planet, maybe a little smaller. So close Terminus it's probably scorched, though. It's also a pretty bright point of light in the daytime sky with all that sunlight.
        Abaddon = This thing's decently sized, and quite close to our home star. If you're careful not to look at Terminus directly it's pretty easy to see with how much light it refelcts.
        Calefact = Just how close to Terminus do planets get?? Calefact reflects enough light to be the brightest thing in the sky after the suns themselves, and is probably a nightmare for visiting spacecraft.
        Esker = A frozen ball of ice orbiting just past our own world, Esker seems like a good early destination, though its peculiar orbit means it never seems to line up optimally. Being further out than Haven, you can see it all night sometimes.
        Bollan = There seems to be a large boulder orbiting Esker. Well, more than a boulder, this thing's an entire moon! Not huge, but bigger than Damocles, and bright enough to see with the unaided eye.
        Dessic = Is this little world all alone? Only about half the size of Damocles, you can only see it by eye because it's closer to Terminus and has more light to reflect. The inclined orbit might make it akward to get to.
        Prometheus = A roughly Haven-sized world in the middle of the habitable zone of our other sun? Seems too good to be true! If you hold your finger up to block Eterna's glare you might be able to see it for yourself.

        // Normal mode discoverables

        Zephyr = While this tiny moon of Tempest is visible to the naked eye in the twilight hours, it's so small that it's impossible to make anything out about it even through a telescope unless you use special adaptive optics or a space telescope.
        Sephon = Orbiting so close to Cerberus's rings, little Sephon is tricky to pick out by eye, but can be seen easily by a telescope - it looks like a blurry stick shaped thingy. Well, maybe not quite that easily seen then.
        CerberusMoonletF = We found a little baby moonlet orbiting inside Cerberus's rings! This one seems to be in the biggest divisions we can make out.
        CerberusMoonletH = We found a little baby moonlet orbiting inside Cerberus's rings! This one seems to be in the biggest divisions we can make out.
        CerberusMoonletB = We found a little baby moonlet orbiting inside Cerberus's rings! This one seems to be in one of the large divisions.
        Arenace = Arenace seems to be about Haven-sized, and orbits Eterna. It's a sandy color, but that's about all you can tell without advanced telescopes.
        Gelis = This world must be ice-cold given its distance from Eterna. It seems to be somewhat larger than Haven, but not large enough to make out surface features without advanced telescopes.
        Torren = Somewhat small for a planet but still decently sized, Torren is pretty close to Eterna. You might be able to make it out by eye if you block Eterna with your finger, but it'd be tricky.
        Apep = It turns out there's been this enormous planet out there this whole time, it's way beyond Eterna and orbits both suns at once. There's very little light so far out, making it hard to see much.
        Ora = Ora's small size and crazy orbit doesn't seem very planet-like, but it's still way too big to be an asteroid. It's pretty far out there and probably tricky to reach.
        Ember = This world orbiting Eterna looks more moon-sized than planet-sized, making it hard to see much. Even so, it does seem to be quite unusual, however.
        Shard = Turns out this is why Ember looked so weird - it was a binary planet! Shard isn't quite as heavy as Ember, but it appears to be about the same size.
        Demil = Our scientists think this tiny asteroid orbiting out in the cold might just be the largest of a whole belt of asteroids orbiting out there. Maybe we'll visit this one some day.
        Cal = A tiny moon orbiting a tiny world far from Terminus, Cal was quite hard to spot. Probably easy to land on, at least.
        Heima = Heima's pretty big for a moon, but Apep's pretty big for a planet so that's not too weird. It must be incredibly cold there with so little sunlight.

        // Always need to be discovered

        CerberusMoonletA = We found a little baby moonlet orbiting inside Cerberus's rings! It seems like it's about to fall right into the planet orbiting so close.
        CerberusMoonletC = We found a little baby moonlet orbiting inside Cerberus's rings!
        CerberusMoonletD = We found a little baby moonlet orbiting inside Cerberus's rings!
        CerberusMoonletE = We found a little baby moonlet orbiting inside Cerberus's rings!
        CerberusMoonletG = We found a little baby moonlet orbiting inside Cerberus's rings! This one seems to be in the biggest divisions we can make out.
        CerberusMoonletI = We found a little baby moonlet orbiting inside Cerberus's rings!
        CerberusMoonletJ = We found a little baby moonlet orbiting inside Cerberus's rings!
        Portent = This little moon must be barely holding itself together with how close it is to Gelis. Half the trouble of discovering it was figuring out whether the thing was rings or a moon, or even just an image artifact.
        Lakh =  A tiny moon orbiting a tiny world far from Terminus, Lakh was quite hard to spot. Probably easy to land on, at least.
        Kono = A decently sized moon orbiting Apep, our scientists say it's probably subject to a lot of heating due to the huge gravity of its parent planet stretching and squeezing it.
        Atrament = This moon is a dark black color, which combined with how little light there is to begin with makes it very hard to see. You'll probably want to pack lights if you go there.
        Rime = This moon's on an odd orbit, but otherwise seems pretty normal. It's probably frozen solid, so far out even air would freeze without extra warmth.
        Erebos = A little asteroid moon orbiting Apep on an odd orbit, we think there's probably tons of moons like it. Scientists have dubbed them irregular satellites.
        Elea = A little asteroid moon orbiting Apep on an odd orbit, we think there's probably tons of moons like it. This one looks like it's actually a binary!
        Honua = A little asteroid moon orbiting Apep on an odd orbit, we think there's probably tons of moons like it. This one looks like it's actually a binary!
        Isathe = We didn't think this one was a moon at first due to how far away it is, but we checked its motion and it is in fact a moon. Isathe actually gets about as far from Apep as Haven does from Terminus!
        Joku = Can a moon have a moon? Apparently so! Joku's discovery came as quite the surprise to say the least.
        Tephra = This asteroid orbiting Eterna is absolutely miniscule, and was quite hard to spot.
        Met = A little asteroid orbiting Eterna, there's probably lots of others like it.
        Dicyr = This asteroid is in an interesting spot - it seems to be at just the right distance from Eterna that it would gets the same amount of light from both suns, depending on what part of its orbit its in.
