	// !!===!! ALL SETTINGS ARE CASE-SENSITIVE !!===!!

	// ==============  VISUAL SETTINGS  ==============
	
	// == whether to use the alternate anamorphic sunflare (completely aesthetic choice - no expected effect on performance)
	//
	// default: false
	useAnamorphicFlare = false
	
	// == whether to use experimental interplanetary planetshine on the inner planets
	//
	// may result in buggy behavior
	// implementation is incompatible with Principia
	//
	// default: false
	useInterplanetaryLight = false
	
	
	
	// =============  SYSTEM SETTINGS  =============
	
	// == whether to use a 2.56x or 10x rescale factor
	//
	// accepted values are stock, 256, and 10
	//
	// default: stock
	useRescale = stock
	
	
	// == whether to change the homeworld to Prometheus
	//
	// this start is noncanon and currently unsupported for career/science mode - rewards will be highly unbalanced
	//
	// default: false
	usePrometheusHomeswitch = false
	
	
	// == whether to load pseudobodies ingame
	//
	// pseudobodies are small celestial bodies that have one tenth the science rewards of the normal celestials they are found near so as to not saturate rewards, and are not intended as primary mission destinations
	// they can be identified by the fact they have catalog numbers instead of names, and smaller, less visible orbit icons
	// currently they are only found in the rings of Cerberus
	//
	// default: true
	usePseudobodies = true
	
	
	// == how many asteroids there should be - at higher levels asteroids both spawn more frequenly and last longer when not tracked; this can affect performance
	//
	// accepted values are low, medium and high
	//
	// high will double the frequency of unknown object spawns as well as their lifetime, while low will halve
	//
	// default: medium
	asteroidRate = medium
	
	
	// whether to use dense asteroids - if true, multiplies the densities of asteroids by 100 to bring them in line with realistic values
	// Currently not implemented, setting does nothing
	// default: false
	useDenseAsteroids = false
	
	
	
	// =============  GAMEPLAY SETTINGS  =============
	
	
	// == whether to extend stock jet engine pressure curves beyond one atmosphere (101.325 kPa)
	//
	// if not extended, they do not gain thrust at higher atmosphere densities, making planes less effective than they should be on worlds like Haven
	// modded engines are not touched, but typically have extended curves already
	//
	// default: true
	useExtendedJetProfiles = true
	
	
	// == whether to modify the expansion ratios of stock and restock+ sea level engines to be balanced against Haven pressure rather than Kerbin pressure
	//
	// this will slightly increase their Isp at Haven's atmospheric pressure as well as the maximum pressure they can operate at, at the cost of their vacuum Isp
	// includes solid rocket boosters but not sustainers (engines between sea level and vacuum performance, e.g. the Skipper)
	//
	// default: true
	useHavenExpansion = true
	
	
	// == whether to modify the range of stock and restock+ antennas to be balanced against the size and progression of the Terminus system
	//
	// when Custom Barn Kit is installed, the DSN (tracking station upgrades) is edited to more cleanly support this, which will happen regardless of whether this setting is enabled due to technical problems
	// this means it is highly reccomended to keep on if Custom Barn Kit is installed
	//
	// added Apep-tier antenna will likely not be accessible in reworked tech trees, untested
	//
	// default: true
	useAntennaRebalance = true
	
	
	// == whether to move fairings and nosecones earler in the tech tree to compensate for Haven's thicker atmosphere
	//
	// only expected to work with the stock tree and extensions thereof (e.g. CTT), if more extensive tech tree reworks are installed, do not enable this
	//
	// default: false
	useEarlyAero = false
	
	
	// == whether to move sepratrons earler in the tech tree to compensate for Haven's thicker atmosphere
	//
	// only expected to work with the stock tree and extensions thereof (e.g. CTT), if more extensive tech tree reworks are installed, do not enable this
	//
	// default: false
	useEarlySepratron = false
