		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = All systems nominal.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = All systems nominal.
		KerbinSrfLanded = Well, at least it was faster than walking.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = Good thing this vessel was waterproof.
		KerbinFlyingLow = Haven's thick atmosphere makes this a very turbulent ride. Hopefully nothing comes apart.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = It's surprisingly smooth flying up here.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The light of Terminus seems so much harsher in space. Maybe we should have brought more sunscreen.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The empty blackness of space is so... empty. A brief wave of panic washes over you as you contemplate the nature of the void a little too much.
		
		DamoclesInSpace = This isn't going to fall into Haven, right?
		DamoclesSrfLanded = Damocles' low gravity makes the landing feel incomplete. You double check to confirm that the ship is indeed touched down.
		
		BrinkInSpace = Brink's surface looks uneven and potentially hazardous to land on. Hopefully just the kind of challenge to break the tedium of this long flight.
		BrinkSrfLanded = The ship settles a surprising amount considering the gravity.

		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = A visual inspection confirms that the vessel and launchpad are in good condition.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = A visual inspection confirms that the vessel and runway are in good condition.
		KerbinSrfLanded = A good opportunity to get some air, but what are we trying to learn from this?
		KerinSrfSplashed = Maybe this isn't the best time for a swim?
		KerbinFlyingLow = This certainly can't be safe.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = Something tells you that being outside is not ideal currently.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Floating next to Haven makes you feel very small.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = So this is what existential dread feels like. Next time maybe don't think about the black infinitude which surrounds us all.
		
		DamoclesInSpace = It looks so much bigger in person.
		DamoclesSrfLanded = Looking up and seeing Haven suspended against nothing is somehow not a comforting sight.
		
		BrinkInSpace = You consider landing with just your jetpack.
		BrinkSrfLanded = Even in the low gravity the ground seems to suck your feet in a little.
