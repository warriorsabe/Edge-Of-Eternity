			description = Small and very close in to Cerberus, Sephon is a rather difficult moon to study from Haven. While its high orbital velocity makes capturing into orbit of it expensive, its size makes landings trivial and an appealing destination for budding space programs. \\nn\\nn Some more radical visionaries have even suggested using it as a refueling depot for daring dives deep into the mysterious depths of Cerberus, given the proximity. Ideas like these have captured the interest of the tourism board, and they are pushing for realization of many of them.
