			description = While Achlys's moon may not be particularly remarkable in size, orbit, or appearance, Kere does have the distinction of being the only moon to have tidally locked its parent to it. This fact is however often disputed as the tidal forces from Terminus would have helped slow its rotation, and some consider Shard to be a moon to Ember rather than a binary companion as often accepted. \\nn \\nn Scientists pushing for a Kere mission point towards the fact that it seems to be very unlike its parent planet, and easier to visit, when proposing their concepts, though they are still often ignored in favor of flashier destinations. Perhaps it's time for this to change.
