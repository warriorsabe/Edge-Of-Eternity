			description = Orbiting at a respectful distance, Esker's sole moon has been of some scientific interest, seeing as its composition seems to differ remarkably from that of its parent. There are two main camps regarding this: one posits that the heat of Terminus burned of Bollan's ice, and the other suggests that it was captured, but neither theory is without its flaws. \\nnIn the media however, there is less debate, as no major film or book has bothered to include it. This makes it mostly unheard of in the public at large.
