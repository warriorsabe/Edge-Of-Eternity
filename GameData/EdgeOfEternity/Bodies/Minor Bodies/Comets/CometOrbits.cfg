Collisions or gravitational interactions have caused it to enter the inner solar system. \n\nThese are the most common variety of comet generally seen, though their true numbers are likely greater still, as many remain unperturbed in the outer belt. Orbital periods can approach 6 years, and comets of this variety tend to be larger on average than their inner belt cousins.

	@description = This comet belongs to an unusual subset of the Eskerian group, which drops very near to Terminus. \n\nAll of these sungrazers have orbits that take them closer to Terminus than Calefact, and tend to have apoterms in the middle of the trans-Eskerian belt. All observed sungrazers are on the larger end. While their origins aren't entirely clear the most commonly accepted origin for them are gravitational interactions with inner planets like Cerberus or Tempest, which is supported by the fact that they often intersect the planets' orbits. However, a few have orbits that cannot be explained the same way, and these remain a mystery.

	@description = This object belongs to the trans-Eskerian belt. While it is in composition cometary and capable of forming a tail like any other comet, its orbit has not been perturbed enough to enter into the inner solar system. \n\nThese comets are far more common than the ones that are bright and visible, though since they often go undetected, their apparent numbers aren't quite so high. Due to their higher periterms, orbital periods are overall longer than active Eskerian comets - from 1.7 to 7 years.

{
	@displayName = Eternan Comet
	@description = This comet originates from Eterna. Collisions or gravitational interactions have caused it to enter the inner Terminus system. \n\nEternan comets come from Eterna's outer kuiper belt, and are rare for multiple reasons: the source region is sparsely populated, disturbed objects tend to approach Eterna, and the influence of the star generally causes their orbits to be disrupted. Orbital periods range from 12 to 32 years, though their orbit is unlikely to remain stable.

	@description = This rare comet originates from the Apep moving group. Some perturbation has caused it to enter the inner Terminus system. \n\nThis group of large, icy bodies is found along and near to the orbit of Apep, seemingly loosed from or by Apep itself. While this is by far the most populous resevoir of cometary bodies, it is rather stable and its comets only rarely find their way into the inner solar system. Objects belonging to this family which approach Terminus can be expected to have periods of no less than 85 years, and potentially as high as 400 years.

	@description = This unusually small comet is likely a fragment of another, larger object. \n\nThe term refers to fragments from all families, so they have a wide range of possible orbits. However, none of them pass exceptionally close to Terminus, as they are too fragile to have survived previous such passes. Due to their distance and small size, they are usually rather unimpressive. They are also rather rare though, as they are hard to spot and usually short-lived.

	@description = The rarest type of comet, this object originates from the vast beyond. Indeed, our solar system is not the only one out there - while they are all too dim and distant to see, other stars do exist. \n\nInterstellar comets like these were once orbiting those other stars. The extreme distances between stars means that practically all interstellar objects miss us, leading to the incredible rarity of their detection. Odds are, it will pass us by, never to be seen again, but Eterna and Apep are capable of capturing these objects if their trajectories are right.
