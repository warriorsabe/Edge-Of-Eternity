//Direct Antennae

@PART[longAntenna] // 16
{
	@description = The Communotron 16 is a versatile and lightweight antenna, suitable for moderate-range communication, long-range backup communication, and eavesdropping on secret government operations. You'll need an antenna like this if you want communications at Damocles or Brink.
	@MODULE[ModuleDataTransmitter*]

@PART[SurfAntenna] // 16S
{
	@entryCost = 400
	@cost = 175
	@mass = 0.004
	@description = A surface mount version of the Communotron-16. Compared to the base model, the 16-S is cheaper, lighter and doesn't need to be extended, allowing it to be active during ascent and entry. However, it isn't as powerful and so can't quite reach Brink on its own.
	@MODULE[ModuleDataTransmitter*]
	{
		@antennaPower = 50000 //0.1x stronger; 2x + DSN 1 can reach Brink

	}
}

@PART[mediumDishAntenna] // DTS-M1
{
	@description = The Communotron DTS-M1 is a fully deployable communications and data transmission system. It has been designed to have a minimal form factor when stowed. Occasional antenna tweaking and swift kicks to the main assembly may be required for optimal performance. One of these is powerful enough to reach all the way to Terminus.
	@MODULE[ModuleDataTransmitter*] //1x + DSN 2 can reach Terminus and Calefact always, 1x + DSN 3 can reach all Terminus planets always

@PART[HighGainAntenna] // HG-55
{
	@description = The Communotron HG-55 high gain antenna allows for blazingly fast directional data transmission, and was originally designed for deep space probes. Please note that Ionic Symphonic Protonic Electronics is not liable for any damages that might result from prolonged exposure to RF radiation. This antenna is capable of providing a strong connection to any of Terminus's planets.
	@cost = 1500
	@MODULE[ModuleDataTransmitter*]
	{
		@antennaPower = 20000000000 //1.3x stronger; 1x + DSN 2 can reach all Terminus planets always, 4x + DSN 3 can reach Eterna most of the time
		@antennaCombinableExponent = 1
	}
}

@PART[commDish] // 88-88
{
	@description = The Communotron 88-88 directional antenna allows for far more reliable communication at longer ranges than previous models. This is thanks in part to its patented parabolic folding design, which our research team maintains was not inspired by an umbrella. Just one of these can provide communications as far out as Eterna.
	@MODULE[ModuleDataTransmitter*] //One just barely reaches Eterna with DSN 3

//Relay Antennae

@PART[HighGainAntenna5] // HG-5
{
	@title = HG-3 High Gain Antenna
	@description = A short range dual purpose communications antenna that can handle either direct communications or short range relays. A couple of these should get enough range to remain in contact during a Cerberus insertion or ejection.

@PART[RelayAntenna5] // RA-2
{
	@title = RA-3 Relay Antenna
	@description = A moderate range relay antenna with automatic store and forward capabilities as well as advanced pathfinding algorithms. Capable of communicating with any of Terminus's main planets, at least occasionally.
	@cost = 2000
	@MODULE[ModuleDataTransmitter*]
	{

{
	@title = RA-30 High Gain Antenna

	@cost = 2700
	@MODULE[ModuleDataTransmitter*]
